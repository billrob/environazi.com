What, do these tree hugging assholes want us living in the caves?
</p>
<p>
	Having said that, there is a big difference between a political environmentalist and a real environmentalist.
</p>
<p>
	I'm all about keeping the earth functioning and no point in destroying it because it would mean the end of humanity anyway.  However, the one main point enviro-nazis forget is...
</p>
<p>
	<h1>The Earth FUCKING Tries To Kill Us Every Minute of Every Day</h1>
</p>
<p>Our survival as a species is dependent upon us beating back the bitch every time she strikes at us.</p>
<p>
	The earth harbors trillions of little bacteria and virii whose who purpose in life is to suck the life from us.
</p>
<p>
	The winds, rains, UV radiation are all trying to kill us.
</p>
<p>The earthquakes and volcanoes are trying to destroy us.</p>
<p>Screw nuclear reactor meltdowns an asteroid the size of a building could annihilate most of the earth, and there is nothing we can do about it.</p>
<p>No the mention the random gamma ray bursts that could break every molecule bond in our DNA if aimed directly at the planet.</p>
<p>Being wasteful and destructive "harms the planet", perhaps, but more importantly it harms my pocketbook.  If you want to save the world, <strike>save the cheerleader</strike> save a dollar.</p>

<p>And fuck the enviro-nazis, who want to use Hilterian levels of propaganda, scare tactics, and the jackboot enforcers of "non compliance".</p>
<p>
Assholes...
